## Model Information
The project employs the **Kimi-K1.5-Preview** model created by Moonshot AI. This model is designed for sophisticated natural language understanding and generation capabilities, making it suitable for various content creation tasks.

## Environment Setup
The project requires the following environment variables:
- `base_url`: The Moonshot API endpoint
- `api_key`: Your Moonshot API authentication key
- `model`: The specific model identifier (kimi-k1.5-preview)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `.env` file with your Moonshot API credentials (as shown in the existing `.env` file)
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the project:
   ```
   # Run the demo directly as a Python module
   python -m src
   ```
5. Alternatively, use the Jupyter notebook or import the module in your Python code
